This app was rejected for being "spam" in that there are similar apps already in the store.

This is a game in the genre of "rogue-likes" that use simple graphics, but provides a complicated strategic experience. There are other "rogue-like" games in the store, but this one is unique in several ways.

Other "rogue-like" games are frequently minor tweaks or adjustments of parent programs like Nethack or Rogue itself. This was created wholly fresh in the genre by a single author, who was since blessed ports of the updates "Community Edition" to several platforms.

It has an active online community, participating in weekly contests, and posting results. There are MacOs, PC, Android, and Linux versions of this game, and they all use the same underlying game engine, which is ported here to an iPad OS verion.

The game has been updated with input from the gaming community, so it stays fresh and consistent, with the blessing of the original creator.

This port makes use of iPad features, allowing a complete experience of the game without needing add-ons such as a keyboard, mouse, or trackpad, though if they're present, they can be used as well.

There was an earlier version of this game on the App store, but the maintainer of that version let his developer account expire. This version is updated with the most current game engine and additional Swift code to best utilize the iPad OS environment.

In short, though this is not a wholly uniquely developed iPad game, it IS a credible port of a popular program, replacing a hole in the App store. Please reconsider this application.
