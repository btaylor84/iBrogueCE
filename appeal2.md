This is a game with a substantial online community. There is no current iOS port of the game. While it's similar to other games in its genre of rogue-like games, that's just an effect of the style of the game. They vary dramatically in actual game play, though they use ASCII style graphics to display the game. 

please see the Reddit forum to see an active and vibrant community around this game, clamoring for an iPad port: https://www.reddit.com/r/brogueforum/

Please reconsider this app for inclusion, since it really is a unique version for the app store.
